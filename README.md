# Note Detector

To detect the notes you are playing on your instrument or from a file

This is (will be) a small web application to read, analyse and detect the notes of audio. With the goal to read the notes played by an instrument.

_This project makes use of a simple pitch analyser I build [Here](https://github.com/kyunwang/pitch-analyser)_

Your browser needs to support the `Web Audio API` to view this demo.
